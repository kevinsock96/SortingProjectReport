# SortingProjectReport
URI CSC 212 Fall 2021 Semester

Goal - To implement the different search algorithims learned this semester, and to learn one more not covered. 

Kevin
------
11/26 - Met up as a group, assigned roles
12/01 - Met again, this time to catch up with each other on current progress of each other's sorts.
12/03 - Commited my first MergeSort Class to the repository. Although the main isn't implemented yet nor time calculations, the algorithim works.
12/05 - Commited my second MergeSort class to the repo. I found out what overloading was, and implemented it. 
12/06 - Commited my third mergeSort Class to the repo. Includes run time of functions. Also have our needed arrays.
12/06 - Implemented main function, everything is running!
12/07 - Powerpoint being updated with graphics and information.
Matt
------
11/26 - Met up as a group and assigned roles
11/27 - Met again to check on progress of other sorts
12/02 - Committed first update to the Insertion Sort repository. Algorithm is functional
12/04 - Added benchmarking to Insertion Sort repository that should be working as intended
12/05 - Added function overloading to Insertion Sort repository that also should be working as intended
12/06 - Added function overloading and benchmarking to pancake sort, seems to be working as intended
12/07 - Added more to the Insertion Sort and Pancake Sort code that prints out what kind of array was sorted with the array and time.

Nick
------
11/26 - Met up as a group and assigned roles.
12/01 - Met as a group again to catch up with each other on current progress of the other sorts.
12/02 - Implemented quick sort algorithm, without time benchmarking or function overloading.
12/03 - Implemented time benchmarking to the quick sort algorithm
12/04 - Implemented function overloading so the quick sort algorithm can sort ints and doubles.
12/05 - Began working on pancake sorting algorithm
12/06 - Uploaded pancake sorting algorithm, without benchmarking or function overloading.
