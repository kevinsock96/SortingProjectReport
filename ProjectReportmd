Kevin
------
11/26 - Met up as a group, assigned roles
12/01 - Met again, this time to catch up with each other on current progress of each other's sorts.
12/03 - Commited my first MergeSort Class to the repository. Although the main isn't implemented yet nor time calculations, the algorithim works.
12/05 - Commited my second MergeSort class to the repo. I found out what overloading was, and implemented it. 

Matt
------
11/26 - Met up as a group and assigned roles
11/27 - Met again to check on progress of other sorts
12/02 - Committed first update to the Insertion Sort repository. Algorithm is functional
12/04 - Added benchmarking to Insertion Sort repository that should be working as intended
12/05 - Added function overloading to Insertion Sort repository that also should be working as intended. 

Nick
------
11/26 - Met up as a group and assigned roles.
12/01 - Met as a group again to catch up with each other on current progress of the other sorts.
12/02 - Implemented quick sort algorithm, without time benchmarking or function overloading.
12/03 - Implemented time benchmarking to the quick sort algorithm
12/04 - Implemented function overloading so the quick sort algorithm can sort ints and doubles.
